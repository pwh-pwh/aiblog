## Introduction

CSS has come a long way since its inception. We've moved from simple stylesheets to complex preprocessors, and now to utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

### The BEM Era

Block Element Modifier (BEM) was a methodology that helped us organize our CSS classes. It was verbose but effective.

```css
.block__element--modifier {
  color: red;
}
```

### The Rise of CSS-in-JS

With React, we saw the rise of CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components and Emotion. These allowed us to scope our styles to components.

### Utility-First CSS

Tailwind CSS changed the game by providing a set of utility classes that could be composed to build complex UIs.

## Conclusion

The future of CSS is bright, with new features like Container Queries and CSS Nesting making their way into browsers.
